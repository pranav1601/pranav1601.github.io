                <h3>Winner of VITHACK'19</h3>
                <p>Awarded <strong>$1500 for the best project and $300 for the best website</strong> at VITHACK'19, a competitive hackathon focused on fintech innovations. My project featured a cutting-edge application that utilized computer vision to detect electronic devices in a home environment. By simply scanning the room with a smartphone camera, the system identified present electronics, enabling the fintech company to tailor personalized advertisements and product suggestions based on actual user possessions.</p>

                <h3>Winner of WTM GDG VIT'19</h3>
                <p>Developed a pivotal <strong>women‚Äôs safety application</strong> for WTM GDG VIT'19, which won accolades for its innovative approach to enhancing women's security in urban environments. The app collected data on past incidents of dangers faced by women and used this data to create a dynamic heatmap. It then provided intelligent routing suggestions to help women navigate through areas with the lowest risk, significantly boosting their safety in potentially hazardous locales.</p>

                <p>Participated in <strong>Code for Good</strong>, an initiative dedicated to bringing basic computer science education to underprivileged schools. I engaged with students who lacked access to computers, teaching them fundamental computing skills and igniting an interest in technology that could potentially transform their futures.</p>
