                <h3>Weather-Application</h3>
                <p>The <strong>Weather-Application</strong> is a web-based platform designed to provide real-time weather data for any specified location. This application is powered by a <strong>Node.js</strong> backend and utilizes <strong>Express</strong> to manage server operations, ensuring smooth data handling and service delivery. It leverages <strong>Handlebars</strong> for templating web pages, creating a dynamic and user-friendly interface that adjusts according to the weather data received.</p>
                <p>The core functionality of the application involves integrating <strong>Mapbox</strong> to retrieve geographic coordinates based on location names and <strong>WeatherStack</strong> to fetch detailed weather information using those coordinates. This dual-API setup allows for accurate and up-to-date weather reports, enhancing user experience by providing essential weather details like temperature, humidity, and wind speed. Hosted on <strong>Heroku</strong>, the application demonstrates a scalable solution for accessing and displaying weather data through a web interface.</p>
                <p>The application also serves as a web adaptation of a command-line weather tool, showcasing my ability to transition functionalities between different platforms and interfaces. This adaptation not only broadens the accessibility of the tool but also illustrates my skills in full-stack development.</p>
